# ocean_ai-website
This is a sample website of an ocean ai system..and some of my coding experiences in the field of the web development.
This website has been actually built using the help of the scripting languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Some of the limitations of this website is that it can be used for reference and also can be helpful for developing any jarvis like ocean system but still this particular website is only a simple front website which is self not connected to any databases in the backend and the provided data in the website is not realtime too..
